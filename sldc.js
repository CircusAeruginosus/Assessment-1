let planning = "outlining the scope of the problem and identifying potential solutions"

let analysisOfRequirements = "collecting all relevant information and requirements from the customer, analyzing the feasibility of developing the requested product, and proposing a solution to the problem"

let design = "using the information and requirements collected to plan out the architecture of the product and outline how each feature in the product should work "

let implementation = "translating the design into code, creating data in the database, and creating interfaces"
