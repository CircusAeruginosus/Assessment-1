/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitDefinition = "a version control system installed and maintained on your local system that maintains a record of your code versions, allowing you to track changes to your code projects."

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////

    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitHubDefinition = "an online database that allows you to upload, keep track of, and share your Git version control projects."

//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 8////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.

//CODE HERE
init.description = "initializes a local Git repository in the folder you are currently in"

init.code = "git init"

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////

clone.code = "git clone"

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*

    following the guidelines above to describe the status command.
*/

//CODE HERE
status.description = "shows the status of the working tree; provides information about the repo you are currently working on"

status.code = "git status"

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'add' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the add command.
*/

//CODE HERE
add.description = "adds file contents to the index to be tracked and to prepare the content staged for the next commit"

add.properties = "git add <file name>"

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'commit' with 'description' and 'code' properties
    following the guidelines above to describe the commit command.
*/

//CODE HERE
commit.description = "records changes to the repository (kind of like 'saving')"

commit.code = "git commit <file name>"


//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'push' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the push command.
*/

//CODE HERE
push.description = "sends the commits from your local Git repository to a remote repository (like Github)"
